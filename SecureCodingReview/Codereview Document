Vulnerabilities Identified:

SQL Injection Vulnerability: In the register_user function, the SQL query is vulnerable to SQL injection because it directly inserts username and password into the query without sanitizing or using parameterized queries.

Recommendations for Secure Coding Practices:

Use Parameterized Queries: Replace the direct insertion of variables into SQL queries with parameterized queries. This helps prevent SQL injection attacks by ensuring that user input is treated as data rather than executable code.
cursor.execute('INSERT INTO users (username, password) VALUES (?, ?)', (username, password))

Input Validation: Always validate and sanitize user input before using it in SQL queries or other operations to prevent unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.

Secure Password Storage: Instead of storing passwords in plain text, use secure hashing algorithms like bcrypt to hash passwords before storing them in the database.

Error Handling: Implement proper error handling to gracefully manage exceptions and errors, avoiding potential information leaks and improving application stability.

Static Code Analysis Tools: Use tools like Bandit for Python to automatically detect common security issues in the codebase during development.

Code Review: Conduct regular manual code reviews to identify and address potential security vulnerabilities and ensure adherence to secure coding practices.
